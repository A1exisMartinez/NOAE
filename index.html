<p class="backgroundnyc"> Graffiti and street art have a rich history in New York City, dating back to the 1960s when young people started using the city's subway system as a canvas for their art. At the time, the subway was covered in graffiti, much of which was political and social commentary. This art form gained popularity throughout the 1970s and 1980s, but it also faced backlash from city officials who deemed it vandalism. Despite the city's efforts to eradicate graffiti, street art continued to flourish, with artists such as Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat gaining international recognition for their work. In the 1990s and 2000s, street art began to evolve, with artists using new techniques and materials to create large-scale murals and installations. Today, New York City is home to some of the world's most renowned street artists, and street art can be seen throughout the city's boroughs, from the Lower East Side to Bushwick. While graffiti and street art still face challenges from law enforcement, they continue to be a vital part of New York City's cultural landscape. </p>
