    <h2 class="aboutmepara"> Hello I'm Yahel Alexis Martinez, I'm a current High School student in NYC, learning about Computer Science & the many amazing thing's you could do if you decide go the route as a Software Engineer. At the very begining when I was introduce to the class we're I would be exposed to both the front-end and also the back-end side of making a website with (CSS), (HTML), & also (JAVASCRIPT). From that day on, I was curoius about maybe going to college and majoring in comp-sci and taking this to the next level. Enough of me chattering but the main reason you are here, is to ifnd the back-story of the creation of this page. Was to help other's explore and learn some thing's that they can take away from Grafiti & or Street Art. The main reason why the main foucus of the website is art, is that there are many way art can be explored and shared and help people as well & you might've not even know that art can help people with mental health like how it helped me through-out the pandemic, and it also me connect to new people who had the same interests like myself in street art and in also grafiti. Being from New York City and especially growing up in the borough of Brooklyn you see art wherever you go and i would like to demonstrate a-lot of that art that is amazing that many won't be able to see. </h2>
